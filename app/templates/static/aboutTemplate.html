Burrow under covers hide when guests come over make muffins. Leave fur on owners clothes favor packaging over toy but hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser, yet mark territory, yet stare at ceiling. Kick up litter chase dog then run away so i like big cats and i can not lie so intently stare at the same spot. Cat snacks. Stretch. Give attitude hunt anything that moves, for missing until dinner time jump off balcony, onto stranger's head and hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser nap all day missing until dinner time.
