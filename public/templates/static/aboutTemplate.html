		    	<h2>We are CORSICA</h2>
		    	<hr>
				<p>CORSICA is a wait-list management system currently being developed by Old Dominion University's CS411 Red Team. We aim to improve the current CS department's wait-list. CORSICA provides students and faculty with a friendly web interface which communicates with the school's central scheduling database. In place of a manual list being keep by advisors, CORSICA adds student to the course's wait-list. A product by students, for students.</p>

				<h2>But how?</h2>
		    	<hr>
				<p>The process is simple. Once the student <a href="http://red411.herokuapp.com/signup" target="_blank">register</a> to the website and queued up for a fulled course, CORSICA will keep track of the list and immediately notify the student once a seat becomes available (via email and text messege, if the student registered their phone number with us). The student will have 24 hours to respond. We believe that this will make the registration process easier for both students and faculty and hope to expand the software throughout the university.</p>
