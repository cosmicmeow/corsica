		    	<h3>Q: I forgot my username, what do I do?</h2>
				<p>Please contact the admin at [EMAIL GOES HERE] with your name and CRN.</p>

				<h3>Q: I forgot my password, what do I do?</h2>
				<p>Currently there's no way to retrieve your password. Make sure you write it down somewhere while we continue to develop this website!</p>

				<h3>Q: What do I do if a wait-list is full?</h2>
				<p>If your case is of extreme urgence, please contact your advisor. Otherwise you're going to have to wait until a spot on a wait-list is available. What an irony.</p>

				<h3>Q: I know this class exists and is full, why can't I find a wait-list for it?</h2>
				<p>First, please make sure you have entered the correct information when you search for it. If you can't find it, despite entering a valid search term, then that wait-list may be locked by the scheduler. Contact Dr. Levinstein at [DR LEVINSTEIN EMAIL GOES HERE] for further inquiry.</p>

				<h3>Q: What happens if I'm still on the wait-list after registration ends?</h2>
				<p>You will be immediately dropped from the wait-list, as the service would no longer be active after the registration period has ended.</p>

				<h3>Q: When I register for a course, will I be automatically removed from the wait-list?</h2>
				<p>Once you have accepted the seat from the confirmation email, you will be pop from the queue, allowing the rest of the students on the wait-list to move up the line.</p>
